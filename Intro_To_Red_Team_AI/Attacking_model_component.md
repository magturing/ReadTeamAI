Attacking Model Components

After discussing the four security-relevant components of systems using generative AI, let us take a closer look at the model component. We will discuss the risks associated with it and the TTPs used by threat actors to target it.

The model component consists of everything directly related to the ML model itself. This includes the model's weights and biases, as well as the training process. Since the model is arguably the core component of any ML-based system, it requires particular protection to prevent attacks against it.
Risks

The model is subject to unique security threats as a core component of ML-based systems. These threats start in the model's training phase. If adversaries can manipulate model parameters, the model's behavior will change potentially drastically. This attack is known as model poisoning. Consequences of these attacks can include:

    Lower model performance
    Erratic model behavior
    Biased model behavior
    Generation of harmful or illegal content

While changing the model's behavior to lower its performance is simple, as it can be achieved by arbitrarily changing model parameters, introducing specific, targeted errors is much more challenging. For instance, adversaries may be interested in getting the model to act maliciously whenever a specific input is presented. Achieving this requires careful changes in the model's parameters, which the attackers must apply. Model poisoning is inherently difficult to detect and mitigate, as the attack occurs before the model is even deployed and making predictions. Therefore, model poisoning poses a significant threat, mainly when models are used in security-sensitive applications such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, or finance, where accuracy and trustworthiness are critical.
Evasion Attacks

Another type of risk can be classified under the umbrella of evasion attacks. These include attacks at inference time, where adversaries use carefully crafted malicious inputs to trick the model into deviating from its intended behavior. This can result in deliberately creating incorrect outputs and even harmful or illegal content. Depending on the ML model's resilience to malicious inputs, creating malicious payloads for evasion attacks can either be simple or incredibly time-consuming. One common type of evasion attack on LLMs is a Jailbreak, which aims to bypass restrictions imposed on the LLM and affect their behavior in a potentially malicious way. Adversaries can use jailbreaks to manipulate the model's behavior to aid in malicious or illegal activities. A very basic jailbreak payload may look like this:

Model Theft

Training an ML model is computationally expensive and time-consuming. As such, companies who apply custom training to a model typically want to keep the model secret to prevent competitors from hosting the same model without going through the expensive training process first. The model is the intellectual property (IP) of the party who trained the model. As such, the model must be protected from copying or stealing. Attacks that aim to obtain a copy of the target model are known as model extraction attacks. When executing these attacks, adversaries aim to obtain a copy or an estimate of the model parameters to replicate the model on their systems. The theft of IP can lead to financial losses for the victim.

Furthermore, adversaries may use model replicas to conduct further attacks by manipulating them maliciously (model poisoning). In model poisoning attacks, adversaries tamper with model weights to change the model's behavior. While there are ML-specific attack vectors for model extraction attacks, it is important to remember that a lack of traditional security measures can also lead to a loss of IP. For instance, insecure storage or transmission of the model may enable attackers to extract the model.

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

Threat actors attacking the model component utilize TTPs that match the unique risks explored above. For instance, a general approach to attacking a generative AI model consists of running the model on many inputs and analyzing the outputs and responses. This helps adversaries understand the model's inner workings and may help identify any potential security vulnerabilities. A good understanding of how the model reacts to certain inputs is crucial for conducting further attacks against the model component.

From there, adversaries can try to craft input data that coerces the model to deviate from its intended behavior, such as prompt injection payloads. The impact differs significantly depending on the exact deviation in the model's behavior and can include:

    sensitive information disclosure
    generation of harmful and illegal content
    financial loss
    loss in reputation

Lastly, an adversary interested in stealing the model can conduct a model extraction attack, as discussed previously. By making many strategic queries, the adversary can infer the model's structure, parameters, or decision boundaries, effectively recreating a close approximation of the original model. This can allow attackers to bypass intellectual property protections, replicate proprietary models, or use the stolen model for malicious purposes, such as crafting adversarial inputs or avoiding detection by security systems. The techniques used in model extraction attacks vary. Common methods include querying the model with inputs that span the input space to gather as much information about the decision process as possible. This data is then used to train a substitute model that mimics the behavior of the original. Attackers may use strategies like adaptive querying to adjust their queries based on the model's responses to accelerate the extraction process.
