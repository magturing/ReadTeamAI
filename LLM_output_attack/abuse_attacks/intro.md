Introduction to Abuse Attacks

Malicious actors can utilize LLM capabilities to facilitate abuse attacks, resulting in the distribution of widespread propaganda, cyber threats, and manipulative narratives, which may pose significant risks to individuals, organizations, and societies. Since LLMs can generate convincing human-like text quickly and at scale, they can be powerful tools for spreading misinformation, hate speech, and aiding in unethical activities. In contrast to the LLM hallucinations discussed previously, Abuse Attacks aim at deliberately generating misinformation.
Propaganda and Psychological Manipulation

Adversaries may weaponize LLMs through the mass generation of propaganda and manipulative content. These LLM-generated narratives may influence public opinion or spread ideological extremism via biased news articles, fake testimonials, and persuasive arguments that align with specific agendas. These generated texts may make it difficult for the public to distinguish between legitimate information and deliberately generated disinformation. On top of that, LLMs can also be used to create and operate social media bots that mimic real users. These bots are often particularly effective in amplifying propaganda and orchestrating large-scale influence campaigns because they can engage in back-and-forth conversations with real users and are thus particularly effective in achieving their purpose. As such, LLM-generated abuse attacks may play a significant role in election interference in democratic countries, as these attacks provide a powerful tool to influence voters for both domestic and international actors.
Cybersecurity Threats and Fraud

LLMs can be weaponized to facilitate cyber threats such as phishing attacks, impersonation attacks, and large-scale social engineering. Traditionally, phishing attempts often contain grammatical or structural errors that may alert users to potential fraud. While this is mostly a thing of the past due to widely available online translators, LLMs may elevate these attacks to the next level by generating compelling corporate emails, government notices, or personal messages with near-perfect accuracy. Attackers can also use LLMs to craft deceptive scams, tricking employees into transferring funds or sharing sensitive data. Additionally, LLMs may be leveraged to automate online harassment campaigns, generating waves of targeted abuse at a scale previously unattainable.
Misinformation, Fake Reviews, and Defamation

LLMs can generate misleading or defamatory content, targeting individuals, businesses, or institutions. Whether positive or negative, fake reviews can manipulate market perception, deceive consumers, or damage reputations. Similarly, LLM-generated deepfake articles can falsely accuse individuals of crimes, fabricate scandals, or spread conspiracy theories. These tactics can be exploited for political sabotage, corporate warfare, or personal vendettas. On top of that, LLMs can be exploited for intentional or unintentional generation and spread of misinformation, including fake news, conspiracy theories, and deceptive narratives. Since these models generate text based on statistical patterns rather than factual accuracy, they can inadvertently produce misleading or false information that appears credible. Malicious actors can use LLMs to create convincing fake articles, impersonate authoritative figures, or fabricate historical or scientific claims. This can lead to widespread disinformation campaigns in politically charged environments, undermining trust in institutions, influencing elections, or manipulating public opinion. Since LLM-generated content can be mass-produced rapidly, misinformation can spread before fact-checkers can respond, making it a powerful tool for deception.
Hate Speech Generation

LLMs can inadvertently generate hate speech if their training data includes biased or prejudiced content. Despite efforts to filter harmful language, implicit biases may still emerge in responses, mainly when the model is prompted with leading or politically charged queries. Malicious actors may exploit LLMs to mass-produce hateful content, targeting specific ethnic, religious, or social groups. LLMs' automated and scalable nature allows for the rapid dissemination of such speech across social media and online forums, potentially fueling division and radicalization. Furthermore, adversarial manipulation, where users craft prompts to bypass safety filters (Prompt Injection), can create offensive or extremist rhetoric that AI developers did not intend.
